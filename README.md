Our app 'Intelens' is a user-friendly app designed for intellectually disabled children aged 8-15, offering engaging activities to stimulate their minds. The app features 3 main sections: i) Learning-where games like Pattern Matching, Counting improve their cognitive abilities, ii)Speech-where children communicate their basic needs to their parents using audio prompts, and iii)Life Skills-where social awareness is taught through videos.
